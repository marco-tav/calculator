# Calculator

This project is about making a simple web calculator that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. It should have at least the add, subtract, multiplication and division operations. The project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, being the final project of the 'Introduction' course.

## How to run it

To run this project just download the repository and run ```index.html``` on any modern browser. Once finished it will be hosted using GitHub's hosting service.

## Status

Preliminary design is finished. The calculator will perform operations with the result of a previous operation and the 'clear screen' button works. Still to be done: calculator still allows multiple operators and it shouldn't. DEL, dot, and +/- still not working.
