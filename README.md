# Calculator

This project is about making a simple web calculator that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. It should have at least the add, subtract, multiplication and division operations. The project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, being the final project of the 'Introduction' course.

## How to run it

To run this project just download the repository and run ```index.html``` on any modern browser. Once finished it will be hosted using GitHub's hosting service.

## Status

Preliminary design is finished, number buttons print to the calculator's screen and also append their value to a variable when clicked. The rest of the functionality is still to be done.
